        The Help Them Keep Warm organization was founded in July 2012, by Mr. Sayed Khan, the current head of the organization itself, he started small by helping those he would drive by on the streets, bringing them blankets and jackets during the cold seasons, eventually he sought to do more and that is why they have their organization today. They provide an assorted variety of warm clothing, please visit the content page on our website to browse some examples. Of course, there is that matter of supplies and employees, Help Them Keep Warm is always at a possible risk of losing its stock, which is why donations of any kind are heavily encouraged, also because the organization is a donation and grant funded project. Donations are accepted either in person or via post. Volunteering is also encouraged, anyone willing to lend a hand is welcomed at Help Them Keep Warm, if you’re interested, you’ll need to visit their website and email them specific information so that they may schedule a meeting and calculate your time spent there so as not to enclose on your personal life too much. The main goal of this organization is to provide for the poor so that when in a crisis people can, at the very least, say they still have the clothes on their back, the focus areas of this charity organization include the poor and helping ensure their survival in the hard street life they have found themselves stuck in. Help Them Keep Warm resides in a national radius in KwaZulu-Natel, Johannesburg and Western Cape, they have plans to expand to international status to ensure the organization may assist the poor communities overseas.
